Java Kdb API Example Code
======================================

This code belongs with the article: [Kdb Java API](http://www.timestored.com/kdb-guides/kdb-java-api).

It demonstrates:
 - Querying a kdb process
 - Subscribing to a kdb tickerplant

It is a simple example only and does not contain good logging, failover, polling or retrying connections. Those things are left as an exercise for the reader.
